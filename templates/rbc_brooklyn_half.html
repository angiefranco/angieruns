                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I ran my first half marathon and I have never experienced this much human emotion.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I woke up at 4:15am on the Saturday morning. I have everything I need for the race laid out in front of me. I have prepared for last 5 months to run this distance today alongside other 25,000 people. On paper, I have prepared and I know I am ready. In reality, I am a nervous wreck, I go from excited to nervous to wanting to stay home and not go to the race at all, and I can't explain it because rationally it doesn't make sense. I think to myself 'it's 4am and I am getting ready to RUN a half-marathon' - and I almost can't believe it because a year ago that would have seemed impossible. But I am awake. It's 4:15 am. I'm doing this.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I have a light PB & banana toast with a cup of coffee and I hurry out the door with Matt at about 5:10AM. We make our way to the subway. Matt has a backapack carrying my post race snacks and a dry change of clothes because it's going to rain. Runners have to get there early, but as nervous as I was of course I overdid it a bit. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I say goodbye to Matt at the runner's entrance and I make my way to my letter corral. It's 6:30AM. My start time is 7:45AM. The waiting game starts and I am trying to meditate, move a little, keep my blood flowing, but I am shaking because of the nerves. It's also cold (for me, but I'm always cold). As I shiver in place, a woman approaches me and starts making conversation. I don't even know her name, but I wish I did. She gave me an aluminum blanket from a past race and the shivering stopped. </p>
